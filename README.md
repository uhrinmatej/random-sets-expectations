A Python-based repository focused on random sets and computation of their expectations, with an emphasis on geometric representation and practical experimentation.

The repository contains:
- `utils.py` file, which implements core helper functions and classes that underpin the computations.
- Jupyter (`.ipynb`) notebooks, which demonstrate the functionality of the implemented methods using examples referenced in the paper. 
- `.json` data files. which store precomputed data used for more precise and faster set visualization.
